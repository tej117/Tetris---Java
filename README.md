# Tetris---Java
This is Modern Tetris which uses SRS rotation, holds and displays upcoming
pieces. This was built from scratch using Java on Intellij.

## Project Description
- The goal for this project was to practice design architecture and improve 
my programming in Java. 
- Tetris is a well known game where the blocks (called Tetrominoes) are dropped
and destroyed by creating lines. The game is over when the blocks
reach the ceiling.
- The playing field is a 20x10 grid, where the pieces spawn at the top
of the board. The pieces fall at a constant rate and the speed picks up
when you clear lines, score points and increase in level.

## Controls
- Move block side to side with the **LeftArrow** and **RightArrow**
- Rotate block clockwise with **X** and anti-clockwise with **Z**
- Instant Drop block with **SpaceBar** and quick drop with the **DownArrow**
- Hold and switch out blocks with **C**

## Future Work 
- The UI interface will be improved
- There will be an AI implementation of the Tetris game, where a player can
play against the AI, like two player battle royale.
